### Accessing the Data

Downloaded the csv file from Kaggle. I began by importing the data into a Jupyter notebook and exploring the data by checking the data types. This allowed me to determine that two of the variables (Model ID and Fuel_type) contain text strings, while all other variables were integer numbers.
